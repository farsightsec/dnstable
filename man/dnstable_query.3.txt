== DESCRIPTION ==

^dnstable_query^ objects encapsulate the search parameters used when querying a
dnstable data source. They can be used to retrieve specific entries from a data
source, or to test whether an already retrieved entry object matches the query.

A ^dnstable_query^ object is initialized by calling ^dnstable_query_init^(),
which takes the desired query type as a parameter. The
^dnstable_query_set_...^() functions are then called to set the query
parameters, as described below.

The functions with return type ^dnstable_res^ either return
^dnstable_res_success^ if the function completely successfully, or
^dnstable_res_failure^ otherwise. If ^dnstable_res_failure^ is returned, the
^dnstable_query_get_error^() function can be called to obtain the error message
text. (The string returned is valid for the ^dnstable_query^ object in question
until the next error occurs or the query object is destroyed.)

^dnstable_query_filter^() tests whether the given ^dnstable_entry^ object would
match the given ^dnstable_query^ object. The result is returned in the
_filter_res_ parameter.

Once the query object has been constructed, ^dnstable_query_iter^() iterates
over all the matching entries in the specified mtbl source.

=== dnstable_query_set_...() functions ===

^dnstable_query_set_rrtype^() sets the Resource Record type, which is specified
as a string. The string parameter can be an RRtype mnemonic like _"A"_ or _"NS"_
or it can be the string "TYPE" followed by the decimal RRtype value.

^dnstable_query_set_bailiwick^() is only valid for _DNSTABLE_QUERY_TYPE_RRSET_
type queries. If set, it causes the bailiwick field of RRset entries to be
filtered against the value provided.

^dnstable_query_set_rrtype^() and ^dnstable_query_set_bailiwick^() are optional.
If not called, no RRtype or bailiwick filtering will be performed.

^dnstable_query_set_skip()^ sets the number of initial rows to skip
from the results.  The default is 0, which means to not skip any rows.

^dnstable_query_set_aggregated^() sets if the results from queries should be
aggregated. The default is _true_ for aggregated results.

^dnstable_query_set_data^() specifies the main search parameter and is required.
Its meaning depends on the query type.

For _DNSTABLE_QUERY_TYPE_RRSET_ queries, the search parameter is the RRset owner
name. Left- and right- hand wildcards are permitted.

For _DNSTABLE_QUERY_TYPE_RDATA_NAME_ queries, the search parameter is the domain
name in the record data. Left- and right- hand wildcards are permitted.

For _DNSTABLE_QUERY_TYPE_RDATA_IP_ queries, the search parameter is an IP
address, IP prefix, or IP range. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. If the search
parameter contains a "/" character it will be treated as an IP prefix. If it
contains a "-" character it will be treated as an IP range. Otherwise, it will
be treated as an address.

For _DNSTABLE_QUERY_TYPE_RDATA_RAW_ queries, the search parameter is a
hexadecimal string which will be directly compared against record data values.
