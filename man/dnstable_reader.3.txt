== DESCRIPTION ==

^dnstable_reader^ is the high-level interface for reading dnstable entries from
a dnstable data source. Results are returned through the ^dnstable_iter^
interface.

^dnstable_reader^ objects can be initialized by calling
^dnstable_reader_init^(), which takes an ^mtbl_source^ object, or by calling
^dnstable_reader_init_setfile^(), which takes a full path name to a "setfile", which is
a text file containing a list of dnstable data file paths, one per line.
The directory name of that path is prepended to each data file's path.
For example, if the setfile path is "/export/dnstable/mtbl/dns.fileset", and
a line in it is of the form "dns.2017.Y.mtbl" then ^dnstable^ will try to open
"/export/dnstable/mtbl/dns.2017.Y.mtbl".

^dnstable_reader_reload_setfile^() will force a reload of a ^dnstable_reader^
object initialized by ^dnstable_reader_init_setfile^() by re-reading the
underlying setfile.

^dnstable_reader_iter^() iterates over every entry object in the data source.

^dnstable_reader_iter_rrset^() iterates over just the entries of type
_DNSTABLE_ENTRY_TYPE_RRSET_. Likewise, ^dnstable_reader_iter_rdata^() iterates
over just the entries of type _DNSTABLE_ENTRY_TYPE_RDATA_.

^dnstable_reader_query^() iterates over all the entry objects that match the
specified query object.
