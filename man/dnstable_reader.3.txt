== DESCRIPTION ==

^dnstable_reader^ is the high-level interface for reading dnstable entries from
a dnstable data source. Results are returned through the ^dnstable_iter^
interface.

^dnstable_reader^ objects can be initialized by calling
^dnstable_reader_init^(), which takes an ^mtbl_source^ object, or by calling
^dnstable_reader_init_setfile^(), which takes a full path name to a "setfile", which is
a text file containing a list of dnstable data file paths, one per line.
The directory name of that path is prepended to each data file's path.
For example, if the setfile path is "/export/dnstable/mtbl/dns.fileset", and
a line in it is of the form "dns.2017.Y.mtbl" then ^dnstable^ will try to open
"/export/dnstable/mtbl/dns.2017.Y.mtbl".

^dnstable_reader_reload_setfile^() will force a reload of a ^dnstable_reader^
object initialized by ^dnstable_reader_init_setfile^() by re-reading the
underlying setfile.

^dnstable_reader_iter^() iterates over every entry object in the data source.

^dnstable_reader_iter_rrset^() iterates over just the entries of type
_DNSTABLE_ENTRY_TYPE_RRSET_. Likewise, ^dnstable_reader_iter_rdata^() iterates
over just the entries of type _DNSTABLE_ENTRY_TYPE_RDATA_.

^dnstable_reader_query^() iterates over all the entry objects that match the
specified query object. The query object is used during the operation of the
returned iterator, and must not be destroyed until after the iterator is destroyed.
