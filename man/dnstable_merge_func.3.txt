== NAME ==

dnstable_merge_func - libmtbl merge function for dnstable key-value entries

== SYNOPSIS ==

^#include <dnstable.h>^

[verse]
^void
dnstable_merge_func(void *'clos',
                    const uint8_t *'key', size_t 'len_key',
                    const uint8_t *'val0', size_t 'len_val0',
                    const uint8_t *'val1', size_t 'len_val1',
                    uint8_t **'merged_val', size_t *'len_merged_val');^

== DESCRIPTION ==

This is the libmtbl merging function for dnstable key-value entries. dnstable is
built on libmtbl, and libmtbl requires a ``merge function'' to resolve
conflicting values between identical keys. The symbol ^dnstable_merge_func^ can
be provided to libmtbl functions requiring a merge function when dealing with
dnstable key-value data.

There are four dnstable ^MTBL^ key-value entry types. ^dnstable_merge_func^
handles them in the following manner:

^ENTRY_TYPE_RRSET_NAME_FWD^ and ^ENTRY_TYPE_RDATA_NAME_REV^ entries have no
associated value (that is, the values for these types is zero length). A
zero-length byte array is provided as the merged value.

^ENTRY_TYPE_RRSET^ and ^ENTRY_TYPE_RDATA^ entries have an identical encoding
format. These types encode a triplet of varint-encoded integers representing the
^time_first^, ^time_last^, and ^count^ value fields. A new triplet of
varint-encoded integers is generated as the merged value as follows:

- The earliest (that is, smallest) of the two ^time_first^ values is taken as
  the merged ^time_first^ value.

- The latest (that is, largest) of the two ^time_last^ values is taken as the
  merged ^time_last^ value.

- The two ^count^ values are added together.
