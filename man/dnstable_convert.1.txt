== NAME ==

dnstable_convert - convert passive DNS NMSG data to dnstable MTBL format

== SYNOPSIS ==

^dnstable_convert^ 'NMSG-FILE' 'DB-FILE' 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE'

== DESCRIPTION ==

Converts passive DNS data from NMSG format to MTBL format.  The input NMSG data
in 'NMSG-FILE' must be encoded using the SIE/dnsdedupe message schema, and the
output data will be written to two separate MTBL files: the 'DB-FILE' containing
"plain" DNS records, and the 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', containing DNSSEC-related
records. (Specifically, all resource records of type DS, RRSIG, NSEC, DNSKEY,
NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, and DLV are stored in the 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', and resource
records of all other types are stored in the 'DB-FILE'.)

The output files produced by ^dnstable_convert^ are suitable for use with other
dnstable tools like ^dnstable_dump^(1) and ^dnstable_merge^(1), or with the
^dnstable_reader^(3) API. Since they are in MTBL format, they can also be read
with the ^mtbl_reader^(3) API.
