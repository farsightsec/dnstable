== NAME ==

dnstable_iter - iterate over a sequence of dnstable entries

== SYNOPSIS ==

^#include <dnstable.h>^

[verse]
^dnstable_res
dnstable_iter_next(struct dnstable_iter *'it', struct dnstable_entry **'ent');^

[verse]
^dnstable_iter_destroy(struct dnstable_iter **'it');^

== DESCRIPTION ==

The ^dnstable_iter^ interface is used to return a sequence of one or more
dnstable entries. Once the caller obtains a ^dnstable_iter^ object,
^dnstable_iter_next^() should be repeatedly called on it until there are no more
entries to retrieve, at which point the iterator object must be freed by calling
^dnstable_iter_destroy^().

== RETURN VALUE ==

^dnstable_iter_next^() returns ^dnstable_res_success^ if an entry was
successfully retrieved, in which case _ent_ will point to a ^dnstable_entry^
object which must be freed by the caller using ^dnstable_entry_destroy^().
^dnstable_res_failure^ is returned if there are no more entries in the sequence.

== SEE ALSO ==

^dnstable_entry^(3)
