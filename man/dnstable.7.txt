== NAME ==

dnstable - encoding format, library, and utilities for passive DNS data

== DESCRIPTION ==

dnstable implements an encoding format for passive DNS data. It consists of a C
library, libdnstable, and several command line utilities for creating, querying,
and merging dnstable data files.

For details about how dnstable entries are encoded in data files, see
^dnstable-encoding^(5).

The command line dnstable utilities are:

^dnstable_dump^(1)::
Prints dnstable format files in text or JSON.

^dnstable_lookup^(1)::
Searches dnstable data files.

^dnstable_merge^(1)::
Merges multiple dnstable data files together.

The main interfaces provided by the dnstable library are:

^dnstable_iter^(3)::
Provides a consistent interface for iterating over the data entries returned by
other interfaces.

^dnstable_entry^(3)::
Encapsulates the fields contained in individual data entries.

^dnstable_query^(3)::
Encapsulates query parameters for searching a data source.

^dnstable_reader^(3)::
Reads dnstable data from an mtbl source.

Also provided is the low-level ^dnstable_merge_func^(3), a libmtbl-compatible
merge function.
