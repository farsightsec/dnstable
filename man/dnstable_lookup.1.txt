^dnstable_lookup^ [^-jJu^] [^-O #^] ^time_range^

^dnstable_lookup^ [^-jJu^] [^-O #^] ^version^ [<ETYPE>]

== DESCRIPTION ==

Looks up records in a dnstable data file or fileset. Results are printed to stdout
in an ad-hoc text format or in JSON format if ^-j^ or ^-J^ are given.
The matching may be done based on the date and time the DNS record
was first and/or last observed.

^dnstable_lookup rrset^ returns RRsets matching the specified owner name
(wildcards permitted). A resource record type and bailiwick domain name can
optionally be specified.

^dnstable_lookup rdata ip^ returns A or AAAA type Resource Records matching the
specified IP address, IP prefix, or IP range.

^dnstable_lookup rdata raw^ returns Resource Records whose record data matches
the specified data value, expressed as a hexadecimal string.

^dnstable_lookup rdata name^ returns Resource Records whose record data matches
the specified domain name (wildcards permitted).

^dnstable_lookup time_range^ returns an entry containing the time range for
data within the data file or fileset.

^dnstable_lookup version^ returns version entries. The optional ^ETYPE^ parameter
can be used to request a specific type's version. ^ETYPE^ may be one of ^rrset^,
^rrset_name^, ^rdata^, or ^rdata_name^

== OPTIONS ==

^-a^ 'datetime'::
    Select results with recorded first seen after this 'datetime'.
    See the DATE TIME SPECIFICATION section below for details.

^-A^ 'datetime'::
    Select results with recorded last seen after this 'datetime'.
    See the DATE TIME SPECIFICATION section below for details.

^-b^ 'datetime'::
    Select results with recorded last seen before this 'datetime'.
    See the DATE TIME SPECIFICATION section below for details.

^-B^ 'datetime'::
    Select results with recorded first seen before this 'datetime'.
    See the DATE TIME SPECIFICATION section below for details.

^-c^::
    This enables complete (strict) matching semantics so no entries with
    a first or last observed time outside the provided time range will
    be matched.
    By default, time-based filtering with ^-A^ and ^-B^ will select
    results if any of the time is within the range (even if some are
    outside the range).
    The ^-c^ means it will not output the entry if it was also
    seen outside the time range.

^-C^::
    Do all matching in a case-sensitive manner.

^-i secs^::
    Print query statistics to ^stderr^ every ^secs^ seconds. Implies ^-s^. 

^-j^::
    Use JSON format for output, with timestamps in epoch time (seconds since epoch).
    Default is 'dig' presentation format.
    One JSON-formatted entry per line will be printed.

^-J^::
    Use JSON format for output, with timestamps in human time (RFC3339 format).
    Default is 'dig' presentation format.
    One JSON-formatted entry per line will be printed.

^-n^::
    Do not output matching record results.
    Only the number of matching entries found is reported to ^stderr^.
    (To see stats when using a JSON format, see the ^-s^ option.)

^-R^, ^--raw^::
    When using a JSON format for output, add a hex representation of the
    raw rdata and the rrtype.

^-s^::
    Output query statistics to ^stderr^ at end.

^-t secs^::
    Limit query time to ^secs^ seconds.

^-u^::
    Output unaggregated results; default is aggregated results.
    This is only valid with a setfile.

^-O #^::
    Offset (e.g. skip) the first # results.

== WILDCARDS ==

Wildcards may be used to match zero or more labels on the
left-hand side or right-hand side of a rrset owner name
or a rdata name.

Multiple or zero labels on a side may be matched by using an asterisk (^*^),
e.g.,
"*.example.com" or "n.example.*".

Exactly one label on a side may be matched by using a plus sign (^\+^),
e.g.,
"\+.example.com" or "n.example.+".

Matching labels only in a middle of a domain name is not supported.
Partial label matches are not supported.
The wildcards cannot be used on both sides of a domain name at the
same time.

== ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ==

Exactly one of the following environment variables must be set in order to
specify the dnstable data file(s) to query.

^DNSTABLE_FNAME^::
    Path to a single dnstable data file.

^DNSTABLE_SETFILE^::
    Path to a "set file", a text file containing a newline separated list of
    dnstable data files on the filesystem. Results from all of the data files
    will be merged.

== DATE TIME SPECIFICATION ==

The ^-a^, ^-A^, ^-b^, and ^-B^ options support various date or time formats.

The date may be represented using
^strptime(3)^ ISO 8601 date formats:
%Y-%m-%d,
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S (space separated),
%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S ("T" separated),
and
%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ ("T" separated with trailing "Z" for Zulu timezone).

The date may be represented using
absolute Unix epoch time in seconds, e.g.,
1577880000 for January 1, 2020 noon.

The date may be represented using
negative relative numeric time in seconds
such as "-300" is 5 minutes ago.

The date may be represented using
timing mnemonics relative to current time:
W for weeks,
D for days,
H for hours,
M for minutes,
and S for seconds.
For example, "52w3d" would be one year and three days before the current
date (to the second);
and "4H30M" is four and a half hours before the current time.
(The letters are case insensitive.)

Due to the parser design, it won't accept a value of zero
or "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z" or earlier.
