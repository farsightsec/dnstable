dnstable (0.12.0)

  * Implement indexing using RRtypes for ENTRY_TYPE_RRSET_NAME_FWD
    and ENTRY_TYPE_RDATA_NAME_REV entries. This uses RFC6840 RRtype
    bitmaps as the primary data structure.

  * Added support for dnstable entries encoding version information and
    time metadata.

  * The version entries, time metadata, and rrtype index information are
    generated by an updated dnstable-convert. Files generated by
    the old dnstable-convert will be processed as they were with the
    previous dnstable versions i.e., the new entry types and rrset index
    information will be absent.

  * Use ./configure --with-coverage option to build with code coverage and
    make targets: clean-coverage to remove the coverage data and results
    and report-coverage to generate LCOV report (after running the code
    such as with "make check").

  * Add -R flag to dnstable_dump and dnstable_lookup to add raw rdata
    representation to outputs.

  * Add long options to dnstable_dump to fix bug in not accepting some
    options properly.

  * Fix dnstable_lookup usage output.

  * Refactor time formatters and fix compiler warnings.

  * Ignore entries which fail decoding for use with legacy empty data.

  * Miscellaneous documentation improvements.

    for filter and query timeouts.

  * Add functionality for unaggregated query results.

  * Add ability to skip query results.

  * Add options for date and rdata presentation in JSON formatted entries.

  * Treat RRTYPE "TYPE255" as an alias for "ANY", since 255 is the code for "ANY".

  * Remove dnstable_convert into a separate repo to simplify
    dependencies. https://github.com/farsightsec/dnstable-convert/

  * Add generated man pages to source.

  * Document dnstable_entry_set_iszone().

  * Improve dnstable_reader(3) documentation.

  * Add JSON output (-j option) to dnstable_lookup.

  * Add test cases based on dnstable_lookup.

  * Only encode RDATA so the hostname is at the beginning for NS, CNAME,

dnstable (0.9.1)

  * Fix strange values in data value triplets (#16). A 'count' field that has
    the value 0 is silently rewritten to 1, and a 'time_last' field that has
    the value 0 is silently set to be the same as the 'time_first' field.

dnstable (0.9.0)

  [ Henry Stern ]
  * New "query timeout" feature which allows for a configurable timeout on the
    execution of certain types of queries. Introduces new function
    dnstable_query_set_timeout() and new result code dnstable_res_timeout
    (#8).

  * New "time fencing" feature which filters based on 'time_first' and
    'time_last' values. Introduces new enum dnstable_filter_parameter_type and
    new function dnstable_query_set_filter_parameter() (#9).

  * Performance enhancement for some IP range and prefix searches (#11).

  * Fix unhandled IPv4/IPv6 address overflow for IP range/prefix queries
    (#14).

  [ Robert Edmonds ]
  * dnstable_convert: Assert vendor 'SIE' and message type 'dnsdedupe' so that
    the following cast of the return value of nmsg_message_get_payload() is
    safe (#10).

  * Use CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE rather than CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW for query
    timeouts (#12).

  * query_iter_next_ip(): Fix zero fill condition (#15).

dnstable (0.8.0)

  * Replace Jansson with YAJL for JSON rendering, which results in a
    substantial performance improvement.

  * dnstable_dump: Add "--rrset_names" and "--rdata_names" options which dump
    the RRSET_NAME_FWD and RDATA_NAME_REV indices.

  * New function dnstable_reader_reload_setfile(), which calls
    mtbl_fileset_reload_now() on a dnstable_reader object's underlying
    mtbl_fileset object, if present. This requires libmtbl >= 0.8.0.

 -- Robert Edmonds <edmonds@fsi.io>  Mon, 31 Aug 2015 19:00:15 -0400

dnstable (0.7.0)

  * New function dnstable_entry_set_iszone(), which controls how the timestamp
    fields are named in the formatted output produced by
    dnstable_entry_to_text() and dnstable_entry_to_json().

  * dnstable_entry_to_json() now produces output compatible with the format
    used by the DNSDB API service. This also alters the JSON output produced
    by the dnstable_dump debugging utility.
